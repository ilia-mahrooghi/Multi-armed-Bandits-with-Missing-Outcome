## 📄 Abstract  

This repository contains the experiments and dataset used in the paper *"Multi-armed Bandits with Missing Outcomes"*.  
The study addresses the challenges of decision-making in environments where the outcome of certain actions (arms) is occasionally missing. We propose a novel approach to handle such scenarios effectively, supported by theoretical guarantees and validated through experiments.
